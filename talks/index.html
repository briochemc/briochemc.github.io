We asnwer this question by embedding a simple data-constrained model of the nutrient, carbon, and oxygen cycles in steady circulations that correspond to perpetual 2090s conditions as simulated for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Focusing on steady-state changes from preindustrial conditions allows us to capture the response of the system on all timescales, not just on the sub-centennial timescales of typical transient simulations. We find that biological production experiences only modest declines because the reduced nutrient supply by a more sluggish future circulation is counteracted by warming-stimulated growth. Organic-matter export declines by 15–25 % due to reductions in both biological production and export ratios, the latter driven by warming-accelerated shallow respiration and reduced subduction of dissolved organic matter. The future biological pump becomes stronger in the sense that it cycles a 30–70 % larger regenerated carbon inventory accumulated over dramatically longer sequestration times, while pump efficiency is reduced in the sense that preformed DIC is shunted away from biological utilization to outgassing. Near-surface paths of preformed DIC become more important in the future as weakened ventilation isolates the deep ocean. Thus, while regenerated DIC cycling becomes slower, preformed DIC cycling speeds up in the future for inventory changes of similar magnitude. Intense global deoxygenation (25–65 % less oxygen globally) is driven primarily by the circulation through (i) increased residence times and total oxygen utilization despite reduced respiration rates, underlining reexposure times as the key link between regenerated carbon and oxygen inventories, and (ii) the decrease of the fraction of the ocean interior that is ventilated from high latitudes, which partially shuts down the corresponding cold and oxygen-rich water supply to the deep ocean.</blockquote> </div> <li><a name=AMOS2024 ></a> <span class=title >Optimal parameters for the ocean's nutrient, Californiarbon, and oxygen cycles compensate for circulation biases but replumb the biological pump</span> <span class=name >AMOS National Conference</span> <span class="dates comma">February 5, 2024</span> <span class=place >Canberra, CT, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('AMOS2024-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/AMOS_Canberra_2024.pdf" title="/pdfs/AMOS_Canberra_2024.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=AMOS2024-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>Modeling the ocean's carbon and oxygen cycles accurately is challenging because of uncertainties in both biogeochemistry and ocean circulation. One solution to reduce the mismatch between observed and modelled biogeochemical tracer fields is biogeochemical parameter optimization. I will present recent work where we show that parameter optimization may compensate for biases of the embedding circulation model by altering the inner workings of the biological pump, with implications for estimating the future response of the ocean system to environmental change. To this end we embedded a mechanistic model of the ocean's coupled nutrient, carbon, and oxygen cycles into two circulation models: OCIM2, which is data-assimilated, and ACCESS-M, which is built from the ACCESS1.3 climate model. We find that parameter optimization reduces mismatch with tracer observations and reproduces the global biological pump strength and regenerated inventories for both circulations, but ACCESS-M export production optimizes to twice that of OCIM2 to compensate for ACCESS-M having lower sequestration efficiencies driven by less efficient particle transfer and shorter residence times. Idealized simulations forcing complete Southern Ocean nutrient utilization show that the response of the optimized system is strongly sensitive to the embedding circulation. In ACCESS-M, Southern Ocean nutrient and carbon trapping is partially short circuited by unrealistically deep mixed layers. For both circulations, intense Southern Ocean production deoxygenates Southern-Ocean-sourced deep waters, muting the imprint of circulation biases on oxygen. Our findings highlight that the biological pump's plumbing needs careful assessment to predict the biogeochemical response to ecological changes, even when optimally matching observations.</blockquote> </div> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=UNSWORC2023 ></a> <span class=title >PCO2: A simple biogeochemistry model embedded in a simple ocean circulation model in matrix form </span> <span class=name >UNSW Ocean Research Carnival</span> <span class="dates comma">February 22, 2023</span> <span class=place >Sydney, NSW, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <a href="/pdfs/ORC_UNSW_2023.pdf" title="/pdfs/ORC_UNSW_2023.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=JuliaCon2021 ></a> <span class=title >Modeling Marine Ecosystems At Multiple Scales Using Julia</span> <span class=name >JuliaCon</span> <span class="dates comma">July 28, 2021</span> <span class=place >Online</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('JuliaCon2021-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCIRrXz2ZS0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCIRrXz2ZS0" target=_blank > <i class="fa-brands fa-md fa-youtube" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=JuliaCon2021-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>Life in the oceans is strongly connected to our climate.

Building on the OCIM's steady-state matrix formulation of the ocean circulation, the AO allows computationally efficient simulations of single tracers controlled by linear mechanisms. Here, we present the AIBECS (for Algebraic Implicit Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling System), an open-source, user-friendly, fast, and modular Julia package, which aims to extend the AO's capabilities to nonlinear, multi-tracer systems, embedded in other circulations than just the OCIM.

Because of its ease of use, the AIBECS is perfect for teaching and exploratory research. Yet, it is designed for cutting-edge research owing to its advanced algorithms and diagnostic capabilities. Under the hood, the AIBECS runs with state-of-the-art nonlinear-system solvers and auto-differentiation algorithms. Combined with highly-efficient parameter optimization or uncertainty analysis tools, it aspires to be at the forefront of global biogeochemistry modeling.

Careful examination of the relationships that arise from differentiating the PDE system reveal analytical shortcuts that the F-1 algorithm leverages. Benchmarks of the F-1 algorithm against five numerical differentiation schemes are shown in the context of optimizing a global steady-state model of the marine phosphorus cycle that depends explicitly on <i>m</i>=6 parameters. In this context, the F-1 algorithm computes the Hessian 16 to 100 times faster than other algorithms, allowing for the entire optimization procedure to be performed 4 to 26 times faster.

Part of the success of ODV comes from its simplicity, which makes it attractive to oceanographers. Current global marine biogeochemistry models, on the other hand, lack this appeal and generally come with a steep learning curve. So steep, in fact, that very few non-modelers ever use these models on their own and computational tasks are delegated to collaborating model experts. This problematic barrier to entry in modeling, which hinders the progress of oceanography, has recently been lowered with the release of the AWESOME OCIM (A Working Environment for Simulating Ocean Movement and Elemental cycling in an Ocean Circulation Inverse Model, or AO), a software with a graphical user interface (GUI) for modeling a single biogeochemical tracer, using — under the hood — linear algebra.< \br> Here I will present some work in progress for developing a new marine biogeochemistry model that builds on the ideas behind the AO and provides users with an open-source, user-friendly, fast, and modular software. Among other goals, this model aims to allow users to represent the coupling of multiple tracers (such as dissolved iron (DFe) and macronutrients) that can be embedded in different models of the ocean's circulation (e.g., swap in the OCIM transport with an average of the MITgcm circulation). The model also addresses a number of features that are currently absent in the AO, like the ability to represent non-linear mechanisms (such as the scavenging of DFe by sinking particles). Additionally, a powerful feature of the OCIM that is not leveraged by the AO is its computational speed, which allows for objective parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis. Most of the model's capabilities stem from the language it is developed in, the Julia language, which is a free, open-source, general-purpose, and fast alternative to MATLAB (the language in which the AO is written).</blockquote> </div> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=UCI2018 ></a> <span class=title >Offline parameter optimization for global marine biogeochemical models</span> <span class=name >UCI Primeau Lab Group Meeting</span> <span class="dates comma">February 18, 2018</span> <span class=place >Irvine, California, USA</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <a href="/pdfs/Primeau_Group_UCI_2018.pdf" title="/pdfs/Primeau_Group_UCI_2018.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <li><a name=OSM2018 ></a> <span class=title >Inverse-model estimates of the ocean's coupled phosphorus, silicon, and iron cycles.</span> <span class=name >Ocean Sciences Meeting</span> <span class="dates comma">February 12, 2018</span> <span class=place >Portland, Oregon, USA</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('OSM2018-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/OSM_Portland_2018.pdf" title="/pdfs/OSM_Portland_2018.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=OSM2018-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>A key question about the iron cycle is how much export is supported by the different iron sources (aeolian, sedimentary, and hydrothermal). Previous studies shut down a given source to quantify its importance, but this approach cannot quantify the source's contribution to export in the unperturbed state because of the system's nonlinearities. Moreover, such studies used forward models that were not objectively data constrained.<br /> Here, we estimate the ocean's steady-state coupled phosphorus, silicon, and iron cycles using a new inverse model embedded in a data-assimilated circulation. The model features the redissolution of scavenged iron, a subgrid topography parameterization, and three phytoplankton functional classes. Phytoplankton concentrations are represented implicitly in the formulation of nutrient uptake. Efficient numerics allow us to optimize biogeochemical parameters against observations. Because iron sources are uncertain, largely due to poorly constrained scavenging, we generate a family of state estimates for a wide range of source strengths. All states have similar fidelity to the observations.<br /> From our state estimates, we quantify the relative contribution of each iron source to export production. This is done non-invasively by labelling each iron type with a suitable passive tracer. We find that the phosphorus and opal exports are well constrained at 8.1±0.3 Tmol P yr<sup>-1</sup> and 171.±3. Tmol Si yr<sup>-1</sup>. The exports supported by each iron type have well constrained patterns. Sedimentary iron supports export primarily in shelf and upwelling regions, while hydrothermal iron supports export mostly in the Southern Ocean. Per source-injected molecule, aeolian iron supports 3.1±0.8 times more phosphorus export and 2.0±0.5 times more opal export than the other iron types. Conversely, per injected molecule, sedimentary and hydrothermal iron support 2.3±0.6 and 4.±2. times less phosphorus export, and 1.9±0.5 and 2.±1. times less opal export than the other iron types.</blockquote> </div> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=UCI2017 ></a> <span class=title >The efficiency of different iron sources in supporting the ocean's global biological pump</span> <span class=name >UCI Half-baked seminar, Department of Earth System Science</span> <span class="dates comma">November 15, 2017</span> <span class=place >Irvine, California, USA</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <a href="/pdfs/HB_UCI_2017.pdf" title="/pdfs/HB_UCI_2017.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <li><a name=AMOS2017 ></a> <span class=title >Response of the biological pump to perturbations in the iron supply: Global teleconnections diagnosed using an inverse model of the coupled phosphorus-silicon-iron nutrient cycles </span> <span class=name >AMOS National Conference</span> <span class="dates comma">February 7, 2017</span> <span class=place >Canberra, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('AMOS2017-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/AMOS_Canberra_2017.pdf" title="/pdfs/AMOS_Canberra_2017.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=AMOS2017-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>We construct a mechanistic inverse model of the ocean's coupled phosphorus, silicon, and iron cycles and analyze the response of the biological pump to perturbations in the iron supply.

We find that carbon and opal export can have opposite responses to changes in the iron supply. For example, a globally uniform reduction in the aeolian iron input increases opal export outside of the Southern Ocean but decreases carbon export there. A path-density transport diagnostic applied to the nutrients shows that enhanced iron limitation can untrap silicon from the Southern Ocean and increase opal export outside of the Southern Ocean. However, enhanced iron limitation also leads to non-diatom phytoplankton exporting less carbon in the tropics and to an increase in the biomass fraction of diatoms, which increases the Si:C export ratio.

We systematically assess the nonlinear response of the biological pump to changes in the aeolian iron supply for a variety of scenarios. Specifically, Green-function techniques are employed to quantify in detail the pathways and timescales with which those perturbations are propagated throughout the world oceans, determining the global teleconnections that mediate the response of the global ocean ecosystem. We confirm previous findings from idealized studies that increased iron fertilization decreases biological production in the subtropical gyres and we quantify the counterintuitive and asymmetric response of global productivity to increases and decreases in the aeolian iron supply.</blockquote> </div> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=AMOS_Brisbane_2015 ></a> <span class=title >The plumbing of the global biological pump</span> <span class=name >AMOS National Conference</span> <span class="dates comma">July 16, 2015</span> <span class=place >Brisbane, QLD, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('AMOS_Brisbane_2015-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/AMOS_Brisbane_2015.pdf" title="/pdfs/AMOS_Brisbane_2015.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=AMOS_Brisbane_2015-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>We quantify the timescales and pathways that set the efficiency of the biological pump (the fraction of the phosphate inventory that is regenerated). We use a data-constrained phosphorus-cycling model embedded in a steady data-assimilated ocean circulation to quantify the pump's leaks of preformed phosphate, its sources of regenerated phosphate, and the pathways with which the combined biogenic particle transport and the water circulation teleconnect different regions of the global euphotic zone. These pathways are quantified by a path density, which is the concentration of phosphate that was last utilized in a region A and that will reemerge into the euphotic zone of a region B, partitioned according to the A–to–B transit-time. Suitable integrals of this path density, computed efficiently by direct matrix inversions, yield the phosphate mass in transit, its flow rate, and its residence time in the aphotic zone. We find that a pump efficiency of (39 ± 2)% has dominant contributions from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (25 ± 1)%, from the Southern Ocean (SO) (21 ± 1)%, and from the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic (EEqA) (12 ± 1)%. The pump’s 61% leak originates predominantly in the SO (75%) and in the SubPolar North Atlantic (17%). While the SO euphotic zone is a large leak of preformed phosphate, it is also the major receptor of phosphate reemerging from depth: The SO euphotic zone is the destination of (62 ± 6)% of the regenerated inventory and of (69 ± 5)% of the preformed inventory. The mean interior residence time of regenerated phosphate reemerging in the SO depends on where it was last utilized: 69 ± 1 years if last utilized in the SO and 500 ± 20 years if last utilized outside the SO. The transit-time distribution of the mass of regenerated phosphate last taken up in the EEqA and reemerging in the SO euphotic zone is bimodal, pointing to two distinct pathways which are quantified using the phosphate path density.</blockquote> </div> <li><a name=Postgrad2015 ></a> <span class=title >An efficient inverse model of the ocean's coupled nutrient cycles</span> <span class=name >Postgrad Conference</span> <span class="dates comma">June 11, 2015</span> <span class=place >Sydney, NSW, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('Postgrad2015-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/PostGrad_UNSW_2015.pdf" title="/pdfs/PostGrad_UNSW_2015.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=Postgrad2015-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>We construct a data-constrained model of the ocean's coupled macronutrient and micronutrient cycles. The model focuses initially on phosphate and dissolved iron. The nutrient cycling is embedded in a data-assimilated steady ocean circulation. Biological nutrient uptake is parameterized in terms of nutrient and physical limitations on plankton growth, without the need of tracers for the concentration of phytoplankton. The uptake parameterization is formulated using a novel, versatile functional form that is able to capture different plankton classes, both in terms of size and species. A matrix formulation of the discretized partial differential equations allows for very efficient solutions and facilitates the objective optimization of key model parameters by minimizing the mismatch with the observed global nutrient climatology. This approach matches observed phosphate and iron concentration with RMS errors of less than 10%. In the near future, the model will allow us to quantify the timescales and pathways with which perturbations in the iron supply are communicated throughout the world ocean's ecosystem. Including the ocean's silicon cycle will elucidate the role of diatoms in the biological pump and the sensitivity of elemental ratios to iron perturbations.</blockquote> </div> </ul> <ul class="talks fa-ul"> <li><a name=PostGrad2014 ></a> <span class=title >Plumbing of the biological pump</span> <span class=name >Postgrad Conference</span> <span class="dates comma">September 1, 2014</span> <span class=place >Sydney, NSW, Australia</span> <ul class="nav nav-icons"> <button onclick="myFunction('PostGrad2014-abstract')">Abstract</button> <a href="/pdfs/PostGrad_UNSW_2014.pdf" title="/pdfs/PostGrad_UNSW_2014.pdf" target=_blank > <i class="fas fa-md fa-download" style="color:rgb(0,85,164)" ></i> </a> </ul> <div id=PostGrad2014-abstract  style="display:none"> <blockquote>Nutrient transport and biological teleconnections of Ocean surface regions are diagnosed in a data-assimilated circulation model coupled to a jointly optimized simple phosphorus cycling model. These teleconnections paint the plumbing of the biological pump: phytoplankton takes up phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) in the euphotic layer, pumps it as dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) through the whole water column, until it is remineralized in the ocean depths and ultimately transported to the surface where it is available again for uptake. The biological pump efficiency (39%) is redefined and computed. Ocean surface regions where biological production takes its origin are defined, out of which major contributors as well as biological leaks are determined: The high latitude ocean regions provide a large quantity of phosphate to other oceans, but contribute very lightly themselves to the biological pump. While the easternmost part of the tropical oceans produce large quantities of utilized phosphorus which is pumped for long average transit times. Using Green functions and adjoint techniques, flow rates, masses in transit, and timescales of biologically utilized nutrients between surface regions of interest are computed: the easternmost part of tropical ocean basins provide the majority of the biology, which reemerges predominantly in the high latitudes. Time-dependent path densities of major teleconnections are then computed, which paint a very detailed and quantitative picture of the phosphorus cycle within the ocean interior: paths associated with long transit times (>1000 yrs) spread through the entire ocean, but are concentrated in the deep Northernmost Pacific, while paths associated with short transit times (<500 yrs) are more localised, and restricted mostly to the surface currents.</blockquote> </div> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Benoît Pasquier.
