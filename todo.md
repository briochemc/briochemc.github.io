- TODO Port rest of data from kellertuer
- TODO Switch from YAML format to use bibtex directly
    This should be doable by manually writing the conversion to the right Dict
    It's going to be ugly and a bit slow but it should work
- DONE Remove extra citation stuff. Just keep Journal and year I think
- TODO Get nice new photo of myself
- TODO test deployment
- TODO Replace old website on www.bpasquier.com
- TODO Add page of collabotors where there the ORCID and personal webpage links will be useful
- TODO Add all software contributions as in CV
- TODO Add CV pdf link
- TODO (maybe) Add online CV
- TODO Remove template fluff
- TODO Add talks
- TODO Add years display in bibliography
    Actually I shouldn't do this: Don't want to bring attention to the 2020 gap in papers.
